# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression-Model
In this project, we identify the most important house attributes that influence the model ability to predict future house prices and also predict the house price with considerable accuracy.
This project uses the dataset in which the house sales data is taken from King County along with Seattle. It includes houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
The dataset has 19 features for the houses and is made from 21613 observations.
